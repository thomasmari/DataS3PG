1) What are the necessary preprocessing steps regarding:
a) classes ?
- remove rows with no target
- there is as many samples (=patients) that are sick as there are healthy patient:

b) categorical features ? 
Transform non-boolean (multi-categorical features) into Boolean (like OneHotEncoder)

c) continuous features ?
- Standardize numeric features : mean = 0, std = 1
- No strong correlations between numeric (& cat) features

2) Confusion matrix:
a)How many patient were incorrectly diagnosed with a Heart disease (false positives) ?
4(FP)
b)How many patient were incorrectly diagnosed as being Healthy (false negatives)?
9(FN)

3) Changing the threshold:
a)What is the precision if we change the threshold to have a 0.95 recall ? 
threshold = 0.1953125 
recall(train) = 1.0   
precision(train) = 0.610062893081761 
b) How many patient were incorrectly diagnosed as being Healthy (false negatives)?
9 patients


4) Choosing an overall metric:

a) If I can compute my test sample probabilities and care more about the positive class, which overall metric should I use to compare classifiers ? 
roc_auc_score to compare different different models, the threshold can be choosen later


b) And if I only have the class predictions and no probabilities ?
sensitivity (Recall)
