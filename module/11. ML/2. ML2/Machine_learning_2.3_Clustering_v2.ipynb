    "# Introduction to clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "Clustering is a machine learning technique used to group unlabeled datapoints in groups called *clusters*. The grouping is done such that similar items are together in the same cluster and items in different clusters are dissimilar from each-other. Typically similarity is defined using a distance measure (Euclidean, cosine, etc). Common practical applications for clustering include: market segmentation, social network analysis, search result grouping, anomaly detection etc.\n",
